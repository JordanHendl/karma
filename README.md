C++ Engine Library &amp; Tools for Game Development.

Trying to make an actual enterprise-level engine myself, using what I've learned in the industry.

My experience is mostly OpenGL & CUDA, so a lot of design decisions might be built around that.

Any suggestions please make to jordiehendl@gmail.com.

Build with cmake & gcc8 on Centos8.

Requires Vulkan 1.2 & SDL2 to compile.

It should be ok to build on other systems, as I use nothing platform-specific, but this is not tested.
